## Composable, type-safe ORM for PureScript

Droplet's is a bit different from other PureScript (or Haskell) SQL libraries. There is no monads, functions to yield columns, or a higher level API abstracting away from the generated SQL query. Instead, the EDSL is made out exclusively of combinators (nearly) identical to their SQL statement counterparts. Likewise, the output of a query is automatically inferred from its projection with almost no need for type annotations or boilerplate type class instances.
